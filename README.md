Welcome to Godson Dawuni homepage!!!

I am a Computer Science Researcher. 
I obtained my Computer Science Master degree in 2020 from University of Ghana under the guidance of Jamal Deen Abdulai.
I conducted research on Software-Defined Networking focused on comparing the performance metrics of three Openflow SDN Controllers - Floodlight, OpenDayLight and HPE VAN. 
Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Kwame Krumah University of Science and Technology. 


My research interests lie in the broad areas of mobile/IoT security, software supply chain security, and cybercrime. In particular, my current research focuses on safeguarding end-users and developers by identifying new attack vectors, and developing data-driven security analysis methodologies to quantify and measure their security and privacy impacts.
