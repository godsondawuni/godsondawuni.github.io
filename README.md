Welcome to Godson Dawuni homepage!!!

I am a Computer Science Researcher. 
I obtained my Master degree in 2020 from University of Ghana under the guidance of Dr. . Prior to that, I earned a Master's degree from IIE CAS in 2015 and a Bachelor's degree from USTC in 2012.

My research interests lie in the broad areas of mobile/IoT security, software supply chain security, and cybercrime. In particular, my current research focuses on safeguarding end-users and developers by identifying new attack vectors, and developing data-driven security analysis methodologies to quantify and measure their security and privacy impacts.
