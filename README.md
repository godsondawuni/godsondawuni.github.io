Welcome to Godson Dawuni homepage!!!

I obtained my Computer Science Master degree in 2020 from University of Ghana under the guidance of Dr. Jamal Deen Abdulai.

I conducted research on Software-Defined Networking focused on comparing the performance metrics of three Openflow SDN Controllers - Floodlight, OpenDayLight and HPE VAN. 

Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. 


My broader research interests are ArtificialIntelligence, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Interthing of Things (IoT) . I am keenly interested in how machine leaning techniques coupled with SDN would secure networked devices such as IoT. 

To this end I have become proficient in using Mininet, Openstack, NS3, Cisco Packet Tracer, Linux, EdgeX Foundry and Node-Red with MQTT for SDN/NFV and Internet of Things (IoT) experiments and deployment.
